# Monty Hall Paradox Simulator

This C++ program simulates the Monty Hall paradox, a famous probability puzzle based on a game show scenario.

## Overview

The Monty Hall paradox is a probability puzzle that models a game show scenario. In the game, a contestant is presented with three doors. Behind one of the doors is a valuable prize (e.g., a car), while the other two doors hide less desirable prizes (e.g., goats). The contestant selects one of the doors, and then the host (Monty Hall) opens one of the other two doors to reveal a less desirable prize. The contestant is then given the option to switch their choice to the remaining unopened door. The puzzle is whether it is advantageous for the contestant to switch or stick with their initial choice.

This program simulates the Monty Hall paradox by running a specified number of simulations and tracking the results to determine whether it's more advantageous to switch doors or stay with the initial choice.

## Usage
